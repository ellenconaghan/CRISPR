## Should Genes Be Modified?

A scientist has performed procedure on twin girls which has the potential to reduce their lifespan.

An [article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/03/gene-mutation-protect-hiv-raises-risk-early-death?utm_term=RWRpdG9yaWFsX0xhYk5vdGVzLTE5MDYwNw%3D%3D&utm_source=esp&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=LabNotes&CMP=labnotes_email) in The Guardian describes an account of a gene editing technique known as CRISPR, which was used to remove a gene to prevent the twin girls from being infected by the HIV virus. 

Many people would agree that in removing a gene to prevent two young girls from being infected by HIV could be seen only as a positive outcome. However, research has shown that there is a shorter life expectancy attached to the removal of this gene. This research begs the question, should scientists be altering genes?

## Gene Editing 

When a disease is passed down from parents to children, it is known as a genetic disease. Through the use of gene editing technologies, these diseases could one day cease to exist. 

One such technology works by modifying genes in embryos that carry a genetic disease; this technology is CRISPR which stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat. 

## How Does CRISPR Work?

CRISPR is based off of a modified method that bacteria use to kill invading viruses. A guide RNA directs a Cas9 protein through the cell until a sequence of DNA is found that matches the sequence programmed into the guide RNA. From here the Cas9 protein cuts the gene, causing a break in the double helix. This break is then repaired with the insertion of a donor gene.
