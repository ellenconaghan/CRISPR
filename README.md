## Gene Editing

When a disease is passed down from parents to children, it is known as a genetic disease. Through the use of gene editing technologies, these diseases could one day cease to exist. 

One such technology works by modifying genes in embryos that carry a genetic disease; this technology is CRISPR which stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. 

## How Does CRISPR Work?

[CRISPR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKbrwPL3wXE) is based off of a modified method that bacteria use to kill invading viruses. A guide RNA directs a Cas9 protein through the cell until a sequence of DNA is found that matches the sequence programmed into the guide RNA. From here the Cas9 protein cuts the gene, causing a break in the double helix. This break is then repaired with the insertion of a donor gene.

## Should Genes Be Modified?

A scientist has performed a gene editing procedure on twin girls which has the potential to reduce their lifespan.

An [article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/03/gene-mutation-protect-hiv-raises-risk-early-death?utm_term=RWRpdG9yaWFsX0xhYk5vdGVzLTE5MDYwNw%3D%3D&utm_source=esp&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=LabNotes&CMP=labnotes_email) in The Guardian describes an account of a gene editing technique known as CRISPR, which was used to remove a gene to prevent the twin girls from being infected by the HIV virus. 

Many people would agree that in removing a gene to prevent two young girls from being infected by HIV could be seen only as a positive outcome. However, research has shown that there is a shorter life expectancy attached to the removal of this gene. This research begs the question, should scientists be altering genes?

## Once the Gene is Gone 

There is some concern towards the editing of DNA in human embryos and the ongoing effects of the procedure. Editing genes in embryos leads on to the editing of germ line cells, and with that, the possibility of passing on genetic modifications to future generations. 

An [article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-017-9931-1) was released in 2018 stating some concerns towards the accuracy of CRISPR technology and the potential harmful effects editing genes could have on future generations. No one can predict the future, and therefore it cannot be known what the effects of gene editing will be on the next generation. 

The case seems to be that scientists either perform procedures based on CRISPR technology and wait to see what the side effects could be, or they ignore the ground breaking discoveries that have been made in the field of gene editing and find a different way to cure genetic diseases.
